# ROADMAP.md

## **Project Overview**
Develop a one-page website for **xalphabet.dev** with:
- A loading screen featuring **xalphabet.dev**.
- A smooth transition effect to reveal the bio content after the loading screen.
- A minimalist design with gray tones.

---

## **Phases of Development**

### **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**
1. **Define the Structure:**
   - A loading screen to display `xalphabet.dev`.
   - Main bio content with a simple profile layout.
2. **Set Up Files and Folders:**
   - Create project structure:
     ```plaintext
     xalphabet-dev/
     ├── index.html
     ├── styles.css
     └── script.js
     ```

---

### **Phase 2: Build the Loading Screen**
1. Create a full-screen overlay.
   - Display centered text (`xalphabet.dev`).
   - Use a dark gray gradient as the background.
2. Implement a CSS animation:
   - Add a fade-out effect to hide the loading screen.

---

### **Phase 3: Develop the Main Content**
1. Create a responsive layout:
   - Display a profile picture, name, bio, and social links.
2. Style the bio section:
   - Use a clean, gray-themed design.
   - Ensure proper alignment and spacing.

---

### **Phase 4: Add Transition Effects**
1. Implement CSS transitions for smooth animations:
   - Fade-out effect for the loading screen.
   - Slide-up or fade-in effect for the bio content.
2. Integrate JavaScript:
   - Trigger transitions using class toggles after a timed delay.

---

### **Phase 5: Testing and Optimization**
1. Test transitions:
   - Check smoothness and compatibility on different browsers.
2. Ensure responsiveness:
   - Optimize the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
3. Optimize performance:
   - Minify CSS and JavaScript files.

---

### **Phase 6: Deployment**
1. Deploy the website:
   - Use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for hosting.
2. Link the custom domain:
   - Configure **xalphabet.dev** to point to the deployed site.
